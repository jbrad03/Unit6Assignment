Submitted by: John Bradfield

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## Summary

NASA Daily Image is an android app that Lists the daily nasa image as well as previous days pictures in a list format.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **emojis here**

## Application Features

Includes one image and two text fields for every daily image entry. Each daily image is contained within a recyclerview.

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [ ] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [ ] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

The following EXTRA features are implemented:
